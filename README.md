# VoluntAPP
WomenWithAmbition's submission to the 2015 Technovation Challenge; VoluntAPP seeks to promote community involvement by helping students locate nearby volunteer opportunities.

VoluntAPP was coded in App Inventor 2, a platform built by MIT. The program can either be run through an emulator on the computer, or through a mobile emulator (downloadable onto Android devices only).

VoluntAPP allows students to search for volunteer opportunities by category or location; a category-search allows students to find opportunities that suit their interests. A location search allows students to find opportunities closest to them. Event coordinators are also able to create and submit events to the application, which are saved to an online database through the use of a Google API.

CHALLENGES FACED:
This project was particularly challenging, the reason being that I had no computer science/programming knowledge when I began coding the program. Despite App Inventor being a "block-based" tool, I didn't find it particularly intuitive. I struggled a great deal with using external APIs and Fusion Tables in order to save submitted information to a database. Trying to get the information to be displayed on a Google Map also proved to be extremely difficult.

MOST PROUD OF:
Frankly, I was proud of the fact that our team managed to finish building the app, what with all the problems we encoutered along the way. Although the finished product was nowhere close to our initial vision, the app was able to present the user with volunteer opportunities and allow them to create events. I was also proud of the way the app looked visually; our team worked hard to develop nice graphics for VoluntAPP, and I think our hard work ended up paying off.
